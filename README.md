HTML Structure

index2.txt: This file sets up the basic structure of a webpage. It links to an external stylesheet (style2.css) and a JavaScript file (script2.js). The core content is within a div with the id page1. Inside, a container class holds three lineone divs, each with an innerline div, that in turn contain five cards divs. There is also a text div with a textBox, a paragraph, and a link.
CSS Styling

style2.css: This file provides the styling for the webpage, defining the layout, colors, and responsive behavior. It includes styling for the container, cards, and text elements, using media queries for different screen sizes.
JavaScript Interaction

script2.js: This file contains the JavaScript code that adds interactivity to the webpage. It uses the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library for animations and ScrollTrigger plugin for scroll-based animations. The code sets up a timeline for the initial appearance of the text and another timeline for the scrolling behavior of the lineone elements.

The content is structured into columns using the lineone and innerline classes.
